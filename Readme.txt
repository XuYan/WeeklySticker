You may have the habit to use stickers to record your new ideas or what you need to do for the rest of a day. WeeklySticker will set you free from attaching stickers on your laptop lol

Record your ideas anytime:
• You can record anything anytime you want in WeeklySticker, even when you don't have Internet access. When you don't have Internet access or not log in your Google account, your ideas will be stored locally. Those ideas will be synced to cloud and can be viewed on different devices as long as you log in your Google account when you can access Internet.

Record your ideas conveniently:
(Alt + P) in PC and (Command + P) in Mac will open and close Sticker Pad conveniently.
(Ctrl + Left/Right arrow) offers an easy way for you to view what you wrote on the next 7 days. 
Select any text you want, right click your mouse and add the selection to a day you want. 
Remember WeeklySticker won't remember what you wrote for past days :)

Clean UI:
• Open, Write and Close. You don't need to save what your wrote explicitly. Using WeeklySticker is as simple as that.

Save Browsing Tabs Conveniently:
• Do you have the habit of opening a lot of tabs when surfing the Internet and leave them open for reference tomorrow when you have your laptop sleep? If you are, I think you may be familiar with the situation that browser runs quite slow when you open it the next day. With WeeklySticker, (Alt + X) will save all your tabs in a bookmark folder, then you can close your browser, reopen it the next day and recover all the tabs with (Alt + V) quickly.
